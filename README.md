  <h1>Sort It Out!</h1>
  <p> This game aims to collect the items falling from the sky in the correct waste bin. Depending on the item, it either belongs in the trash can or recycling bin. If you get the item in the correct bin, you gain 3 points (accumulated in the top left). If you get the item in the wrong bin, you lose 3 points, so make sure you put the items in the correct bins! If you miss the item, you lose 1 point.</p>
